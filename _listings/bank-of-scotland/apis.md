description: The Bank of Scotland is a commercial and clearing bank based in Edinburgh,
  Scotland. With a history dating to the 17th century, it is the fifth-oldest surviving
  bank in the United Kingdom (the Bank of England having been established one year
  before), and is the only commercial institution created by the Parliament of Scotland
  to remain in existence. It was one of the first banks in Europe to print its own
  banknotes and it continues to print its own sterling banknotes under legal arrangements
  which allow Scottish banks to issue currency.
